# Python Projects

A curated collection of small Python programs and practice projects built as part of my learning journey through **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu.

These projects demonstrate my growing proficiency in Python fundamentals, control flow, data structures, and basic user interaction â€” all structured and versioned professionally using Git.
